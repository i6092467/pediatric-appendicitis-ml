# Machine Learning & Pediatric Appendicitis

This repository holds the code for the analysis of the data from pediatric patients with suspected appendictis. Machine learning (ML) models are trained and validated to perform the prediction of the diagnosis, management, and severity. The resulting models were deployed as a research prototype of the [Pediatric Appendicitis Prediction Tool](https://papt.inf.ethz.ch/).

This reserach was carried out by the [Medical Data Science research group](https://mds.inf.ethz.ch/), ETH Zurich, Switzerland, in collaboration with the [University Children's Hospital Regensburg (KUNO)](https://www.barmherzige-hedwig.de/kinderchirurgie-und-kinderorthopaedie/ueber-uns.html), Germany, Research and Development Campus Regensburg (WECARE), Germany, and Department of Pediatric Surgery and Pediatric Orthopedics, Hospital St. Hedwig of the Order of St. John, Regensburg, Germany.
